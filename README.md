## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Anton and i identify as a Software Developer, and youâ€™ve landed on my page where you can find a bunch of repositories of my personal projects. Some are at the bare starting stage, some are at the stage of finished POCs, and some are complete. Each project has a brief overview in the README: Problem, Solution, Status. Feel free to explore; maybe you'll find something that helps or inspires you.

I maintain a [public digital garden of notes](https://devirium.avvero.pw), sharing interesting things I encounter.
